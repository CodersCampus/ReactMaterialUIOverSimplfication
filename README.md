# React & Material UI Over Simplfication

This project does 'un-natural' acts that humans should never do.

It creates React on a web page without the normal build infrastructure.

## Why?

When teaching React without the normal coursework, it is not possible to teach without teaching the build infrastructure first.

Thus, a simple "hello world" React component gets surrounded with dozens of files and hundreds of node dependencies that only tend to confuse the visitor who might only be there for a few seconds, if you don't teach the build infrastructure first.

## How to launch this code

From the command prompt

```bash
open index.html
```

Or if you prefer to skip the above command prompt approach, go to your browser, `File Open` and navigate to the `index.html` in this project.

## Material UI Demo

[Material UI](https://mui.com/) is a collection of React Components implementing google's Material Design.

- Google does not maintain MUI
- MUI uses Material Design as the basis of their work.

So if you want to use Material Design but prefer to consume it as React components, this is probably how you would do this.

## To See the Material UI Demo

Same warning about 'un-natural acts' above applies here. No one would ever do it this way in real life.

To see the page.
1. Go the React page (`index.html`) as above
2. Click on the Material UI link at bottom
